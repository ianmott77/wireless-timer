 ## Alpine Ski Racing
 In alpine ski racing a racer starts at the top of a run, and goes through a wand which starts thier time and the finish is triggered by "eye's" at the bottom. Finish eyes traditionally use some form of LASER or light break beam. During training sessions some teams will use wireless timing systems which are capabale of doing this task with no wired set up required. This is a great training tool as it can tell you who is going fastest and when people are improving, and most teams who have them are able to see more improvments. One issue with current systems is they are expensive, some of them are outdated and haven't been upgraded in decades, and many of them are not very user friendly. Thats why this project was born! The goal is to use Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's to to create a wireless timer which is cheaper, and aims at usability.
 
# Things You Should Know Before Continuing
* How to solder
* Basic C/C++ programming knowledge would be an asset (e.g. loops, constants)
* Basic Knowledge of Linux systems (e.g. file system, terminal use)
* How to upload Arduino libraries
* How to import new Arduino libraries

# Hardware
The idea behind the harware set up is that the Arduino is used for sensor's for the outside world while the Raspberry Pi (RPi) is responsible for handling the display as well as doing the information processing and storing information.

### Diagrams
If you look in the diagarams folder you will find fritzing diagrams of how the different pieceies need to be set up. The RPi and Arduino are connected through two different connections, the serial pins (UART) and I2C.

##### Notes
Where the wires disapear in the diagram is where they connect to a Waveshare 4" resitive touchscreen LCD. Another thing to note is that in my set up I used a 6600 mAH battery.

# Software
## Repositories
### Raspberry Pi
* WirelessTimer: https://github.com/ianmott77/wireless-timer-rpi
* pi_power (modified): https://github.com/craic/pi_power (Big thanks to @craic!!)
### Arduino
* WierlessTimer: https://github.com/ianmott77/wireless-timer-arduino

* LIDARLite V3: https://github.com/garmin/LIDARLite_v3_Arduino_Library
## Set Up 
## Arduino
To set up the the software for the Arduino start by downloading the WirelessTimer repo. The CLI folder contains the main program for the Arduino while the Conneciton folder contains the framework that it's built on. To install the program add the Connection library to the Arduino software (instruction here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries).

#### Device ID
Inside the repo you will also find a folder named "tools" inside this folder you will find a script name "WriteDeviceID" in order to set up the Arduino we need to write a Device ID to it's EEPROM which will be saved permamnetly and should be unique for all the timers in your network. If you open up the script you will find a script like this
```
#include <EEPROM.h>
#define DEVICE_ID x

void setup(){
    EEPROM.write(0, DEVICE_ID);
}
void loop(){}
```
In order to write your desired unique device ID to the Arudino simply change where the "x" is to the unique device ID number you want and upload it to the Arduino. The device ID will be save permanently to the Arduino,after you run this script once you won't have to run it on an Arduino again unless you are changing it's device type.

 
#### Device Type
Inside the repo you will also find a folder named "tools" inside this folder you will find a script name "WriteDeviceType" in order to set up the Arduino we need to write a the device type to the Arduino. There are 3 different device types 

* 1 = Starter
* 2 = Interval (Finish Eyes)
* 3 = Monitor Node (not yet implemented)

```
#include <EEPROM.h>
#define DEVICE_TYPE x

void setup(){
    EEPROM.write(1, DEVICE_TYPE);
}
void loop(){}
```
In order to set the device type of the Arduino simply change the "x" in the script to the device type of you need and upload it to the Arduino. The device type will be save permanently to the Arduino, after you run this script once you won't have to run it on an Arduino again unless you are changing it's device ID.

#### CLI
The final set up step for an Arduino is to upload the CLI script. Once you have done that you are done!

## Raspberry Pi
### Operating System
This project uses Raspbian Stretch Lite (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) as it's base but requires several steps to set up. In future this wil all be rolled in to a custom image but currently requires manual set up.
#### Configuring Raspbian
##### Downloading and seting up the MicroSD
In order to set up the Wireless timer software you first need to write the Raspbian Lite image to a micro SD card which is compatible with Raspberry Pi Zero W's (most micro SD's should work). If you're not sure how to do this you can find detailed instructions here:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

To login the default username for the OS is "pi" and the default password is "raspberry"

#### Installing Display Drivers
The Waveshare screen should work with and HDMI connection from the RPi by default however the display may be the wrong orientatation and it may be the wrong resolution, and the touch functionality won't work properly. You can follow the instructions found here:

* https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4inch_HDMI_LCD

to setup the display properly. Once the drivers are installed you can test wheather or not it is working with the program evtest. evtest is used to test input. It can be installed by typing```sudo apt-get install evtest``` and it can be run by typing ```evtest```. If you are not getting any input when touching the screen, check the connection and that you have the screen connected to the proper pins on the RPi.

#### Setting up pi_power

In order to set up pi power you can follow the instructions here however read bellow for the modifications made for this project:

* https://github.com/craic/pi_power

however the scrpipt hosted in this respository is set up to use GPIO12 for boot up and GPIO13 to repace GPIO25, because GPIO25 is used by the touch screen, and the max and minmum voltages are adjusted for the battery I used.

In pi_power GPIO14 is used to power up the RPi because it goes high when booting up but goes low when powering down, however GPIO14 is the TX pin for the RPi and used by the Arduino to communcate. In order to accomidate this we simulate GPIO12 going high when booting by using a custom device tree blob, detailed instructions on how to set this up can be found here: 

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/pin-configuration.md

in order to simulate GPIO12 going high when the RPi boot's we set it to output mode, and active. I have provided a dt-blob.dts in this repo which does that and should allow GPIO12 to be high after holding the momentary push button for a couple second and will go low when the RPi shuts down.

#### Setting up QT and EGLFS
Currently the only way to use this project is to build the WirelessTimer from scratch and currenty the only host system tested so far is Ubuntu 17.10.

The Raspberry Pi portion of the project is based on QT. You can download QT for free here: 

* https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5 

In order for the WirelessTimer program QT needs to be installed on the raspbery pi's. Detailed instructions can be found here:

* https://wiki.qt.io/RaspberryPi2EGLFS

This process can take several hours so be patient and pay careful attention that you are doing the steps correctly. 

Once QT has been successfully installed the following QT modules also need to be installed:
* Qt Declarative (https://github.com/qt/qtdeclarative)
* Qt Quick Controls 2 (https://github.com/qt/qtquickcontrols2)
* Qt Quick Virtual Keyboard (https://github.com/qt/qtvirtualkeyboard) (not used currently but will be in future)

if you have followed all the instructions correclty you should have a kit setup where you can upload compiled Qt programs to your RPi.

Now all you need to do is download the WirelessTimer repo and import the porject folder and it should be able to run the program.
